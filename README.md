# wota-JKT48

I am currently trying to create a website for JKT48 fans. I am making this project as a way to channel all the developments I have gained over the past few months since I last made my Personal Portfolio Website project.

Sunday, March 17, 2024
With this, I declare to start the project "Ngidol With Us" without a team and carried out by myself, Leo Ferdiansyah.

Goals:
- To be completed by Wednesday, August 28, 2024.
- A fully functional website with various best features.
- Fullstack with good Front-end and Back-end system.

Expectations:
- To finish earlier than the targeted date.
- I can smoothly complete this project without any obstacles.
- I hope my enthusiasm in making this project will not diminish or disappear easily.
- Once this project is completed, I hope it will serve as motivation for myself to stay motivated, never give up, and continue learning to achieve my dreams.
- I also hope this can be a motivation for beginner or learning Web developers to stay motivated.
